2. Frontend (Angular):
    - User Interface: Implement a responsive user interface.
    - Authentication: Register, login, logout functionalities.
    - Task Management: CRUD operations for tasks.
    - Task Assignment: Interface for assigning tasks to users.
    - Filters/Search: Interface for filtering and searching tasks.
 
3. Integration:
    - Connect Angular frontend with Django backend using REST APIs.
